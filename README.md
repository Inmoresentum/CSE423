# CSE423 FALL 2023 Labs Assignment

This Project contains all the assignment problems and solutions that I submitted in
**JAVA**.

### Prerequisites

What you will need is just basic Java knowledge and a bit of experience with Maven. 

## Setup

To get started, you will need a suitable [jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.
For this project, I used [Corretto 8 jdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html) to avoid any sort of issues.

However, if you are using [IntellijIdea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you clone this project and open it with it and then Open the `Project Struecture` from the top
right corner or you `find action` menu to open it up. After that, go to project and change the SDK to the JDK version of your choice. Make sure to change the language level and 
also make sure to make change in the [pom.xml](pom.xml). Wait for it to finish downloading all the dependencies, and then you are good to go.

Alternatively, you set it up using whatever way you prefer.

## Getting Started
* You can find all the assignment questions in the [Lab File](/src/main/java/Lab%20Files)
* Each Lab Package contains a .docx file which contains the screenshot and the submission code.
* Have fun.
